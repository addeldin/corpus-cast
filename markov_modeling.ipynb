    "This notebook works pretty differently from txt_from_web.ipynb. The other notebook is meant to get a bunch of text files for you to analyze. In theory, you would go through it, get what you want, and go back to it as-needed for more text. \n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, `markov_modeling.ipynb` is more interactive, and you're intended to fill certain blocks with your own code to make use of the main object: marky the Markov Model Manager! The functions you can make use of are described in the code blocks, but I'll also have a block with examples of the functions being used, and how you might make use of a Markov Model Manager object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is that marky will take the folder you set in section 0 as `root`, create any missing folders, and allow you to handle file management and markov model building all in one place! You can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* import text files and turn them into markov models\n",
    "* import markov models from json files\n",
    "* create new models and then export them as json files\n",
    "* combine models and export the result as a json file\n",
    "* create formatted sentence outputs for any model so you can test models and fiddle with settings\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: the reason jsons are used here is because you can convert a markovify model to json, save the json, and convert the json back later. Making a model from json is way faster than remaking the model from a string. Get more info on markovify here: https://github.com/jsvine/markovify)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another model managing object, nern the Stage Manager, for managing text files representing scripts. Right now, nern is separate from marky so that if you do have scripts you can use nern exclusively (it has all the same functionality as marky), but otherwise you can just use marky.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Note that nern requires scripts in the texts/scripts folder to be formatted a certain way. Each line should be a line of dialogue, formatted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Character: Dialogue.`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then use nern-specific functions to make strings/markovify models based on certain characters, groups of characters, or of the script without any character tags. Basically, nern leverages the formatting of a script to let you do a little more detailed model-generation based on characters."

    "The main \"things\" nern has are the same dictionaries as marky (so you can call `nern.models` or `nern.jsons`), but our main string dictionary will be `self.scripts` instead of `self.texts`. The new dictionary is a more detailed version of `self.texts`, which mapped names of texts to their contents. By contrast, `self.scripts` maps names to a tuple of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(script_contents, dialogue_map, groups)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The dialogue map is a dictionary, mapping character names to a list of every line of dialogue they have in the script. (Note that `dupes` helps ensure there aren't duplicates in this dictionary.) The groups, taken from those defined in section 2.0, allow you to generate strings/markovify models for entire groups of characters. You have to predefine these because the computer doesn't know what the character names mean, or their relationships. The groupings are significant to you, not the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For what it's worth, you won't be calling this tuple, so don't worry too much about the structure of `nern.scripts`. You'll pretty much never be calling it directly unless you're trying to poke around (which, y'know, feel free). You'll mostly be using a few functions for making models based on the names of scripts in your `txts\\scripts\\` folder, and otherwise using it very similarly to how you'd use marky."
