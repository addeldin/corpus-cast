    "This notebook works pretty differently from txt_from_web.ipynb. The other notebook is meant to get a bunch of text files for you to analyze. In theory, you would go through it, get what you want, and go back to it as-needed for more text. \n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, this notebook is more interactive, and you're intended to fill certain blocks with your own code to make use of the main object: marky the Markov Model Manager! The functions you can make use of are described in the code blocks, but I'll also have a block with examples of the functions being used, and how you might make use of a Markov Model Manager object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is that marky will take the folder you set in section 0 as `root`, create any missing folders, and allow you to handle file management and markov model building all in one place! You can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* import text files and turn them into markov models\n",
    "* import markov models from json files\n",
    "* create new models and then export them as json files\n",
    "* combine models and export the result as a json file\n",
    "* create formatted sentence outputs for any model so you can test models and fiddle with settings\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: the reason jsons are used here is because you can convert a markovify model to json, save the json, and convert the json back later. Making a model from json is way faster than remaking the model from a string. Get more info on markovify here: https://github.com/jsvine/markovify)"
