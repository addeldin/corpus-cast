# corpus-cast
This repo contains notebooks and data for generating a novel, specifically for [NaNoGenMo 2021](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2021/issues). I made these to be as hopefully intuitive/usable as possible for people with a solid beginner-to-intermediate level of comfort with Python. There's lots of description/context in markdown cells, and the functions/steps are, at least from my perspective, well-documented. Please feel free to send questions or suggestions to me!
## data
